# GolferTeamPairingApp
Using a list of golfers &amp; their Indexes teams are selected by ABCD or Random using the Course HCP
The list of players and their indexes is imported from the GHIN database.
They are added to a listBox for easy selection to bild a list of players for a given day.
Using the Course details (Slope, Rating, Par) for a given set of tees their course HCP is calulated.
The players are sorted based on their HCP and the teams are made to have similar total team HCPs.
Another pass is made in an effort to balance the teams to have an equal number of WHT TEE and GOLD TEE players.
Additionally, If there are an odd number of players the master is offered to play blind TWOsomes.
This opens a form that displays random pairing kicking the low point scorer (STABBLEFORD) out.
The high point getter along with the winning teams are highlighted (Front, Back, Total).
Another special form for WOLF is opened. If there are 5 players this form has the calculation for individual points.
These points are used to in-turn calculate the cash payouts.
