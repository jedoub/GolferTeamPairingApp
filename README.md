# GolferTeamPairingApp
Using a list of golfers & their Hcp Indexes, teams are selected by ABCD ranking using the Course HCP or Randomly.
The list of players and their indexes is a text file exported from the GHIN database.
As players are selected they are added to another listBox to build a list of players for a given day.
Using the Course details (Slope, Rating, Par) for a given set of tees their course HCP is calulated.
The players are sorted based on their HCP.
The teams are built after sorting to have similar total team HCPs.
Another pass is made in an effort to balance the teams to have an equal number of WHITE TEE and GOLD TEE players.
The APP support up to 28 players, 7 teams of 4.
If there are an odd number of players the APP offers the group leader to play as threesomes or include a blind draw or to play blind Twosomes.
These options are based on the number of players on a given day.
If two-man teams is selected and there is an odd number of golfers a new form is displayed. 
This form shows the random pairings, with an option to kick out the low point scorer (STABLEFORD) and re-pair his partner with the odd man.
The high point getter along with the winning teams are highlighted (Front, Back, Total).
Another special form for WOLF is opened. If there are just 5 players.
This form has the calculations of individual point differentials used to in-turn calculate the cash payouts.
