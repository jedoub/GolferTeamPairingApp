# GolferTeamPairingApp
Using a list of golfers & their Hcp Indexes, teams are selected using ABCD ranking based on their Course HCP, manually or Randomly.
The list of players and their indexes is a text file exported from the GHIN database.
A SlopeRating text file is also included to detail 4 sets of tees (White, Gold, Red, Green).
As players are selected they are added to a separate listBox to build a list of players for a given day.
Using the Course details (Slope, Rating, Par) for a given set of tees their course HCP is calulated.
The players are sorted based on their course HCP.
The teams are built after sorting to have similar total team HCPs.
Another pass is made in an effort to balance the teams to have an equal number of WHITE TEE and GOLD TEE players.
The APP supports up to 28 players, 7 teams of 4.
If there are an odd number of players the APP offers the group leader to divide the golfers in several ways.
Make teams of 3 or include a blind draw in four-man teams or for smaller groups to play as blind twosomes.
If two-man teams is selected a new form is displayed. 
This form shows the random pairings, with an option to kick out the low point scorer (STABLEFORD) and re-pair his partner with the odd man.
The winning teams are highlighted (Front, Back, Total), as well as the highpoint player.
If there are just 5 players, another special form for WOLF (an individual game for 5) is opened. 
This form has the calculations of the players point differentials used to in-turn to calculate the cash payouts.
Finally, in an effort to prevent the same players playing on a team consecutive days I save the pairings and note the team they were on.
The group leader can manually swap players after the new pairings are made where necessary.
